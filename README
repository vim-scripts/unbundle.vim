Unbundle activates Vim scripts from isolated directories by adding them to
Vim's runtimepath and building missing helptags for documentation therein.

It's like vimscript #2332 but with filetype-specific bundles and less code.

See https://github.com/sunaku/vim-unbundle#readme for more information.

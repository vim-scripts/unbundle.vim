INTRODUCTION                                                    *unbundle-intro*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unbundle activates your |bundles| and |ftbundles| by adding them to Vim's
'runtimepath' and building missing |:helptags| for documentation therein.

*bundles* are Vim scripts that are stored in isolated `bundle/*/` directories
(by default; but this is configurable via |g:unbundle_bundles_glob|) found
within Vim's 'runtimepath' array.  For example, `~/.vim/bundle/*/` would be
your |bundles| by default if you were using |Unix|.

*ftbundles* are |filetype|-specific |bundles| that are loaded lazily, as and
when they are necessary, to shorten Vim's |startup| time.  Similar to
|bundles|, they are stored in isolated `ftbundle/{filetype}/*/` directories
(by default; but this is configurable via |g:unbundle_ftbundles_glob|) found
within Vim's 'runtimepath' array. For example, `~/.vim/ftbundle/{filetype}/*/`
would be your |ftbundles| for {filetype} by default if you were using |Unix|.

CONFIGURATION                                                  *unbundle-config*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

g:unbundle_bundles_glob                                *g:unbundle_bundles_glob*
		Defines a filesystem |glob| pattern that matches your |bundles|.

		The default value of this configuration parameter is: >
		let g:unbundle_bundles_glob = 'bundle/*'
<

g:unbundle_ftbundles_glob                            *g:unbundle_ftbundles_glob*
		Defines a filesystem |glob| pattern that matches your |ftbundles|.
		Inside this pattern, all `'{filetype}'` substrings are treated
		as |wildcards|: they are globally replaced with the |filetype|
		of the |ftbundles| that we are currently attempting to load.

		The default value of this configuration parameter is: >
		let g:unbundle_ftbundles_glob = 'ftbundle/{filetype}/*'
<

INVOCATION                                                      *unbundle-usage*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it is sourced, |unbundle.vim| activates your |bundles| and also registers
an |autocommand| to activate your |ftbundles| as and when they are necessary.
You can manually re-run some of this logic using these commands and functions:

:Unbundle                                                            *:Unbundle*
		Activates |bundles| that have not already been activated by
		passing |g:unbundle_bundles_glob| to the |Unbundle()| function.

Unbundle({glob})                                                    *Unbundle()*
		Unbundles directories matched by the given {glob}, unless they
		have already been unbundled, and returns them in 'path' form.

		Any `*.vim` files that have the same basename as directories
		matched by the given {glob} will be |source|d before their
		corresponding directories are unbundled.  This allows such
		`*.vim` files to configure bundles before they are unbundled.

:Unftbundle {filetype}                                             *:Unftbundle*
Unftbundle({filetype})                                            *Unftbundle()*
		Unbundles directories associated with the given {filetype},
		unless they have already been unbundled, and returns them in
		'path' form.  Multiple |filetype|s can be specified as a {glob}.
		For example, to unbundle `'html'`, `'css'`, and `'javascript'`
		|ftbundles|, pass `'{html,css,javascript}'` into this function.
